# First-Web-App

Code for my first web project, for the UNSW course TELE3118, Term 3, 2020. 

### **Part 1 [5 points]**
Populating database: In this part we write a UDP client program that sends a message to a UDP server requesting the list of students and their marks. We store this information in a JSON file.

To run:
- Download the directory ```part1```
- Enter the following into your terminal: ```python udp_client.py```
- Observe this returns the list of student marks in the form of a JSON file

### **Tutorial**
Contains sample code and notes from the course tutorial video.
